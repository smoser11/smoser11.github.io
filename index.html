<h2 id="day1">Day 1</h2>

<p>On the seven-hour train ride:</p>

<ol>
<li>Overheard: (young girl) &#8220;May I have cheese, please?&#8221;; (reply inaudible); (young girl) &#8220;I DON&#8217;T LIKE CHEESE!&#8221;</li>
<li>Last leg of trip was 3 hours on a fully packed train. I always try to reserve a seat. And I did this time (D 88, I still remember). I find the seat and there is someone sitting there so I say &#8216;excuse me, I think you&#8217;re sitting in my seat.&#8217; And the lady says loudly &#8220;there are no reserved seats.&#8221; I start fumbling in my pocket for my ticket with assigned seating, but before I can show her she follows up with &#8220;and I&#8217;m six months pregnant.&#8221; &#8220;Oh wow! You trumped me with that last one!&#8221; I say and leave to stand near the exits until a seat becomes available. I felt bad after the encounter. I felt like she thought I was trying to get one over on her and she was broadcasting this opinion.</li>
</ol>

<p>I got in around 7pm today. The sun goes down very late in the summer so I took some photos of the harbour. It was full of floating boats and waves crashing into the barrier walls.</p>

<p>The only deli selling fresh vegetables closes at 4pm, so I had a light dinner, which is good for me.</p>

<h2 id="day2">Day 2</h2>

<p>Today the entire harbor is dry! Today I learned that tides go in and out daily. Thank goodness! Otherwise I was worried about the harbor!</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>I guess as the tide went out it pulled all the strung up boats out and formed an odd patter of boats on sand and an array of ropes tying them to shore.</figcaption>
</figure> 

<h2 id="day3">Day 3</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m feeling refreshed. This is me at breakfast time:</p>

    <figcaption>Is that 'refreshed?!'  Sadly, for me, likely so :)</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p>I was going to go on a big hike to the south, but decided to stay in the harbor area and write postcards. On the way to the shop I learned that Mousehole has a bell-tower. Like a clock tower that chimes every hour. In Oxford &#8211; and even in Nottingham &#8211; there are church bells that ring on the hour/ on the quarter hour. But those are religious. This clock tower appears secular. At the post card shop I learned there is a Mobile Post Office that visits the village once a week for about an hour. Just my luck that it was here, then. So I bought stamps and took a selfie:</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Yes. That is a walk-in mobile Post Office in the back of a van.  The lady working there both sells stamps and drives the van from town to town!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the walk back, I passed a cottage called &#8216;Peppercorn.&#8217; <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> I cannot understand this property.</p>

<figure>
<img src="20230805_171834.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
    <figcaption>What is this place?!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The front looks to be a souvenir shop and/or art studio. There are <em>loads</em> of small figurines, trinkets, and hippy-symbols. The top of bi-door is usually open, the bottom usually closed. As it is located on a fairly high-traffic road, I thought it was a sort of stall to sale wares. But if you poke your head in, you will see a bed, a child lounging on it, and parents in the kitchen behind. I bought a rock from in front.</p>

<p>Around 5pm I was watching the tide come in (apparently, daily). Some people were wearing wet-suits (like surfers) and some just swim trunks. I struck up a conversation with a woman and asked about the wet suits. Turns out is it (1) for parents who are too lazy to apply sun-block to their kids and (2) to keep body temperature up. I looked out over the harbour &#8211; at this time of day it is also a beach. I decided I might want to take a dip. Why not? But then my brain immediately want to procrastination / scaredy-cat mode,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> But then I said to myself: &#8220;Fuck it. Lets do this now.&#8221; So I walked back, put on my swim-trunks, grabbed a towel and headed out.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> I made it about 10 feet before turning back. I see why they wear wet-suits.</p>

<h2 id="day4">Day 4</h2>

<p>Today is CARNIVAL DAY!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what that is. Lets find out! <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>The first thing carnival day means is <em>parade</em>. I saw more overalls than fake parrots, and more pirates than overalls.</p>

<p>The second thing it means is <em>sand-castle competition</em>.</p>

<h2 id="day5">Day 5</h2>

<p>Boat ride!</p>

<p>While waiting for the boat to arrive at the doc (yes, I was actually early for once!) I saw lots of kids in wet-suits jumping from the barrier walls into the sea. They all said &#8216;hi&#8217; to each other. Do they live here? Where do they go to school? Or are under-ten-year olds just naturally friendly to one another?</p>

<p>Vertigo-inducing clouds, from the boat:</p>

<ol>
<li>Today was sunny and everyone was out. Most have dogs.</li>
<li>All the roads are also walk-ways. They are very narrow and bendy. Cars and people sometimes take turns.</li>
<li>Seagulls (or cormorants?) are everywhere. I don&#8217;t mind their squawks, but I see how it would bother some.</li>
<li>All the cottages have names, mostly nautical themed like &#8220;Pilot&#8217;s Cabin&#8221; or &#8220;Harbor End.&#8221; The cottage I am stay at is called &#8220;Bird House,&#8221; perhaps because there is a balcony on the top floor. I love it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Random musings from a mouse:</p>

<p>I also discovered a crazy-cool foot-path. But not one like I&#8217;ve seen before. It was like something out of the TV show &#8216;Lost.&#8217; Lush and green and overgrown and rushing water and seemingly inexplicable non-human-made-looking constructions.</p>

<p>It has been so long since I had a vacation (a.k.a. went on holiday). Before I left I was worried I might have forgotten how to &#8216;go on holiday.&#8217; But I got back into it quickly. I really like it: it is like re-focusing all my attention on doing/ achieving things, but not for work. I basically always work on academic stuff (or work on things that I can convince myself are academic so as to really procrastinate e.g. &#8216;researching how to be more efficient at research.&#8217; Ha!). And I always have a perpetual &#8216;to do&#8217; list that seems to only get longer. But now my to do lists are things like: &#8216;post cards&#8217;; &#8216;figure out where to buy fresh vegetables&#8217;; book a boat ride to see local wildlife. A really, really nice change of pace!</p>

<p>Plus: right now I&#8217;m sitting on a balcony looking at an amazing view, with a cool breeze gently coming and going.</p>
